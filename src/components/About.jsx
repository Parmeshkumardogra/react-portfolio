                    Hello everyone! My name is Parmesh Kumar, and I'm a dedicated software developer with over 8 months of experience. I have a strong background in various technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, React.js, Python, Core Java, Git, and GitHub.
                    <br />These technologies have been instrumental in shaping my career as a proficient developer.  My passion for coding drives me to continuously learn and adapt to emerging technologies.
                    <br /> Aside from coding, I find joy in working within a team, brainstorming ideas, and collaborating to develop innovative solutions. 
                    I believe that combining technical expertise with effective teamwork leads to remarkable outcomes.
                    Thank you for visiting My Portfolio!
